  In an effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, most governments have imposed restrictions on movement, association, and other civic freedoms in the interest of public health. In many cases, such as New Zealand, these emergency measures have been temporary and respect for human rights has returned to normal. In many other instances, however, governments have used these restrictions to suppress opposition and more permanently restrict civic space. Systematically measuring the consequences of COVID restrictions, however, is a difficult task. We will examine two possible quantitative measures of the relationship between of COVID restrictions and civil society space. First, we will use the Variety of Democracy project's newly released Pandemic Violations of Democratic Standards Index to explore if and how civil society restrictions predict pandemic backsliding. Second, while many countries sign international human rights treaties that ostensibly bind states to respect rights, several treaties allow for emergency derogations from these obligations. We will tabulate formal human rights treaty derogations due to the pandemic and explore whether these emergency measures led to lasting declines in associational and human rights. We hope that our exploration of these two measures will provide rich data-based descriptions of the relationship between COVID restrictions and civic space that will allow for more causal work in the future.

Combatting a deadly virus like SARS-CoV-2 requires extraordinary public health measures that often conflict with personal rights and freedoms. In an effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across the world have imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement, association, assembly, and other civic freedoms in the interest of public health. While countries are ostensibly free to make these emergency domestic policy decisions within their own borders, many states are also bound by international human rights treaties. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have declared states of emergency and formally derogatated (i.e. temporarily suspended) their international treaty obligations. However, far more countries have adopted emergency measures and restricted individual liberties than have derogated from human rights treaties. While some states that have formally derogated with temporary and proportionate emergency responses, as advised by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights [@ohchr:2020], others have used these emergency measures to suppress opposition and more permanently restrict civic space. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how many countries have formally derogated from their human rights treaty obligations and how does the nature of measures implemented during this period differ across countries? In the long-term, we aim to use our rich data-based description of the relationship between pandemic restrictions and civic space to examine whether these emergency measures led to lasting declines in associational and human rights, furthering the phenomenon of closing civic space.

Studying state compliance with the international human rights treaty obligations as well as the (unintended) effects of derogations is important, especially given the ongoing prior phenomenon of closing civic space. Even prior to the pandemic, since 2013, 91 countries had proposed or enacted 244 measures restricting civil society [@icnl:2021]. In Human Rights Watch's 2016 World Report, Executive Director Kenneth Roth argued that civil society was under more aggressive attack than at any time in recent memory. ANDREW: DO YOU WANT TO INCLUDE SOME SUMMARY FIGURES FROM OUR DATA/CLOSING SPACE CHAPTER??

TODO: I will do that ↑

According to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL), since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, 107 countries have declared official states of emergency, with 56 implementing measures affecting freedom of expression and an astonishing 139 imposing measures affecting freedom of assembly [@icnl-covid]. Many other countries have erected new barriers to public information, limited media access, engaged in government-sponsored disinformation campaigns, and penalized dissent. Some countries have prevented NGOs from delivering services and banned civil society organizations from carrying out their missions. Others have used pandemic restrictions as an excuse for delaying elections [@ifes:2020] or to denying arrested individuals adequate legal representation in judicial proceedings [@unodc]. The pandemic has led to a marked increase in human rights violations around the world.

States that are signatories to international human rights treaties are arguably bound to uphold them and limit potential violations of human rights. While many countries have been able to implement emergency public health measures without (1) requesting formal derogations from international treaties or (2) violating mass human rights, many others have essentially violated their treaty commitments. While issuing derogations is not necessarily a sign of impending human rights violations, several countries have already renewed their initial derogations, leading to concerns of a rise in serial derogators and a potential for emergency measures that are neither proportional nor temporary.

Using original data on derogations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) during the pandemic as well as new data collected by the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project on emergency measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, we find 1) HOW MANY COUNTRIES ACTUALLY DEROGATED 2) Countries that implement emergency measures while legally derogating from their treaty commitments ARE DOING WHAT/CONFIRM less likely to violate non-derogable rights during the pandemic ONCE WE HAVE FULL DATA 3) ANY OTHER FINDINGS

TODO: I'll add those things ↑

# Derogations

Derogations in international law authorize states to temporarily suspend their international treaty commitments during times of crises, providing them with flexibility in responding to national crises. However, because derogations are only triggered during extraordinary times of war, disease, and other extenuating circumstances, these suspensions of obligations occur when individual liberties are under serious threat [@HBderogations, 674, 677]. By declaring a state of public emergency and formally derogating, states acknowledge that these measures are temporary, necessary, and proportional to the interest at stake, with an aim to restore normalcy as soon as possible. Derogations provide an important temporary escape hatch—without the ability to derogate, countries facing emergencies may outrightly violate their treaty commitments under international law. Further, they may also illegally violate non-derogable rights such as right to life, freedom from torture, and slavery.

While the most frequent derogators are stable democracies and countries where domestic courts can exercise strong oversight of the executive and hold them responsible for breaches of human rights agreements, derogations—especially in the context of a long-lasting event such like a pandemic—are more concerning because of the tendency of some countries to turn into "serial derogators." These countries generally derogate "without providing information about rights restrictions and in multiple consecutive years" [@HBderogations, 675]. These patterns are typically encountered in countries where the judiciary is weak and voters cannot easily remove leaders from office.

## Derogations during the pandemic

The exceptional circumstances brought on by the global pandemic has led to numerous extensive derogations. International human rights treaties typically lay out circumstances during which derogations may take place. For signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights, for instance, derogations can be made "in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation" [@ohchr:2003, 815]; for the American Convention on Human Rights, derogations are allowed in "time of war, public danger, or other emergency that threatens the independence or security of a state" [@ohchr:2003, 859]. In the current version of this paper, however, we focus on derogations—and violations—from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), arguably the most significant and extensive treaties in the international human rights regime.

The ICCPR was adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 19, 1966 and came into force on March 23, 1976. It was designed to recognize "the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family" and it outlined dozens of articles aimed at creating conditions where everyone can enjoy their civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. Like other human rights treaties, the ICCPR allows the suspension or derogation of certain civil and political rights only under specific situations "public emergency which threatens the life of the nation" [@iccpr].

Recognizing that public health exigencies would require states to curb civil and political rights, the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) published guidance on emergency measures on April 27 2020, stating that any emergency measures must meet specific criteria of legality, necessity, proportionality, and non-discrimination. Further, the OHCHR reminded countries that states of emergency are specifically regulated under human rights law and that "states should take measures to prevent human rights violations and abuses associated with the state of emergency perpetrated by state and non-state actors" [@ohchr:2020]. The OHCHR concluded with a reminder of the necessity of maintaining democratic norms and practices, including transparency, the right to information, media freedom, respect for rule of law, and allowing dissent.

However, given the ongoing trend of limiting civic space, many of these democratic freedoms have been under assault for years. Additionally, trends in democratic backsliding more generally raise concerns that many states may be using emergency measures intended to deal with the pandemic as a way to permanently suppress civic space and limit human rights.

TODO: Do states formally derogate before doing this? How many do that?


# Data

We explore these questions by combining two datasets. V-Dem's thing + our own collection of ICCPR derogations


# Derogations, democracy, human rights, and civil society

## A typology of derogations

4 different outcomes


# Case studies

As shown above, numerous countries derogated from their ICCPR obligations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many of these countries implemented measures that exceeded the recommended legal, necessary, temporary, and proportional standards. The violation of human rights—whether or not a country formally or appropriately derogated—poses important consequences for civic space.

In the long-term, while we assess this above relationship through the use of systematic data through quantitative means, below, we conduct some exploratory case illustrations. These cases show the range in variation in how states have responded to their international legal commitments - some have derogated as intended, some have officially derogated from their treaty commitments but their measures are arguably not considered as temporary and proportional as necessary. Yet, other countries have avoid derogating completely, thus violating their treaty commitments.


## A: Derogated as intended

TODO: Stuff here

## B: Officially derogated but measures not temporary or proportional

Armenia reported its first COVID-19 case on March 1, 2020. As the number of cases rose, the government proclaimed a state of emergency on March 16, citing Article 3 of the Armenian Constitution which requires "the State to take measures for the protection of the life and health of individuals."[^arm-decision] Subsequently, Armenia also officially derogated from Articles 9, 12 and 21 of the ICCPR,[^articles-iccpr] as well as Article 11 of the ECHR[^article11-echr] on March 20, 2020.[^nv-arm-3] For both treaties, Armenia extended its original 30-day state of emergency—expected to end on April 14, 2020—another 30 days to May 14. The country issued five total 30-day extensions to the state of emergency and requested corresponding derogations.[^nv-arm-lots] Armenia's state of emergency finally concluded on September 11, 2020, and it issued a notice of withdrawal of derogation from the ECHR on September 16, 2020.[^nv-arm-9]

[^articles-iccpr]: Article 9 protects against arbitrary arrests and detentions; Article 12 protects the right of individual movement; Article 21 protects the right to assembly.

[^article11-echr]: Article 11 protects the right to assembly and association.

[^nv-arm-lots]: See Note verbale Nos. 3201/C-084/2020 (March 20, 2020), 3201/C-127/2020 (April 17, 2020), 3201/C-165/2020 (May 14, 2020), 3201/C-191/2020 (June 15, 2020), and 3201/C-223/2020 (July 15, 2020).

Some of Armenia's derogations have had a negative impact on vulnerable populations even though they were intended to be non-discriminatory. Its decision to derogate from Article 9 of ICCPR was neither a necessary nor a proportionate measure to aid them in halting the public health crisis caused by the pandemic as it caused further issues to public health and to the judicial system. Detainess were particularly affected by this derogation, as Article 9 of the ICCPR gives the right to a fair and timely trial. By derogating from this article, the Armenian government disproportionately targeted detainees in comparison to the rest of the population. As the Armenian government grappled with the rapidly spreading pandemic, they tried to slow its spread through the judicial system by halting court proceedings. This resulted in overcrowding of facilities, which subsequently posed a risk to the health of detained individuals and to public health in general [@MamulyanAleksanyan:2020]. This problem was exacerbated by the government's decision to repeatedly prolong its derogations.

Victims of domestic abuse were also unintentionally harmed by the government's decision to proclaim the state of emergency and derogate from both Article 21 of the ICCPR and Article 11 of the ECHR. As these proclamations meant that people could not leave their houses after a certain time and could not congregate with others, many women found themselves trapped in their homes under constant surveillance of their abusers. National police recorded no increase in reports of domestic abuse—however, the Ombudsperson's Office and various NGOs received an influx of reports after some measures had been lifted [@Mkrtchyan:2020].

## C: Emergency declared but no formal derogation

Egypt has been under a constant state of emergency since April 1, 2017, and the country has regularly extended its state of emergency every three months since then, including May 2020, October 2020, and January 2021 [@gsod-egypt]. Prior to March 2020, this continual state of emergency was unrelated to public health and was instead focused on stifling dissent, but in the wake of COVID-19, the government began to use the language of pandemic prevention to justify its ongoing emergency measures. Though the Egyptian government has formally declared a state of emergency domestically, it has not formally filed for derogations from any of its international treaty obligations, including the ICCPR, ratified in 1982 [@ccpr:2020]. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Egypt has implemented numerous measures that violate its ICCPR duties.

A large part of Egypt's pandemic restrictions focus on limiting freedom of movement and freedom of speech. There have been bans of all gatherings and more stringent media regulations in an effort to block false information. These regulations have caused many news websites and social media accounts to be blocked for spreading rumors about the pandemic. Since February 2020, at least ten doctors and six journalists have been arrested for spreading false information or for criticizing the government's response [@ap-egypt-covid:2020]. However, the government has not specified which information is false [@rsf-egypt:2020], creating massive uncertainty for journalists reporting on the pandemic.

In restricting freedom of movement, in addition to closing all shops and flights, the government also instituted a curfew with fines of up to 4,000 Egyptian pounds (\$255 USD) or prison for violators [@MouradLewis:2020]. By September 2020, the government had relaxed some of the restrictions on movement and gatherings, but had not lifted the restrictions on media and information [@icnl-covid]. This is part of a longer trend—since 2018, Egyptian law has allowed authorities to censor "online media outlets, websites, and personal social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers" [@rsf-egypt:2020]. The government's anti-COVID measures align well with its continuing campaign to reduce civic space and limit dissent.

## D: No emergency, no formal derogation

To illustrate the impact of pandemic restrictions and its impact on civic space without a formal declaration of emergency and consequent notice of derogation, we look at the case of India. According to Article 352 of India’s constitution, India is only allowed to declare a state of emergency to when its territory is threatened "by war or external aggression or armed rebellion"[^art352]—*not* in the case of public health crises. Despite having a total of over 11.5 million cases since the start of the pandemic and the implementation of measures to protect a sixth of the world’s population, India has not derogated from any of their treaties and instead has simply violated them. Without officially derogating, there is an absence of sunset clauses that typically ensure that there is an end to the measures a country implements during an emergency. Many of the measures against COVID-19 that have been implemented seem to disregard many fundamental human rights that should have been protected even in a state of emergency. This is vital because India is a party to both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) and the ICCPR.

[^art352]: Part XVIII—Emergency Provisions—Article 352, <https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf1/Part18.pdf>

When India went into lockdown in March 2020 the government only provided a four-hour notice, leaving many scrambling in confusion and desperation. This four-hour notice violates Article 19 of the ICCPR, which guarantees the right to seek and receive information, including early warnings of national measures like the lockdown. Not only is this a violation of the ICCPR, the CESCR General Comment No. 14 says that "access to information concerning the main health problems in the community, including methods of preventing and controlling them" is also a guaranteed right [@amnesty-covid:2020]. The lack of notice stranded a large numbers of migrant workers in cities, far from their homes in rural areas, with no transportation. Many of these workers died while trying to walk hundreds of miles back to their villages [@ChaudhryPrasad:2020].

Other measures have disproportionately impacted journalists' ability to work. For example, the Maharashtra government "prohibits organizations or individuals from publicizing information about the coronavirus without ascertaining prior clearance from relevant government health authorities" [@icnl-covid]. While these kinds of measures may have been intended to prevent the spread of misinformation, they have been used to suppress journalists and activists. The government has also used pandemic restrictions to arbitrarily arrest and detain opponents to the regime—including those protesting the government and its Hindu nationalist policies [@YasirSchultz:2020]. Subsequent to their arrest, detainees have had limited access to legal counsel, which has delayed their bails and led to their continued detention [@hrw:2020].

Many measures have also violated the right to privacy, which is not only protected by both the ICCPR and the CESCR[^iccpr17], it is even recognized as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. Concerns over enhanced surveillance techniques have also risen also due to a lack of security measures in sensitive information pertaining to the pandemic. There have been multiple leaks of personal information of infected peoples which has led to discrimination and even assault. These measures have led to some cases of Muslims being assaulted, harassed and denied medical attention or spikes in caste-based discrimination and violence during the pandemic [@Ayyub:2020].

[^iccpr17]: Article 17 of the ICCPR states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation."

Overall, India cannot declare a state of emergency due to the fact that its constitution only allows for a state of emergency to be declared under a physical threat to their territory. Since it can not declare a state of emergency, the government can not officially submit to the UN their intent to derogate from their treaties. Because the state can not derogate, it simply violates its treaty commitments. In putting its entire population under lockdown with little warning, many women suffered disproportionately and other minority groups such as Muslims received backlash and discrimination, both of which are non-derogable violations of Article 4 of the ICCPR. The lockdown also violated rights such as the right to information, the right to free movement, the right to privacy, and personal safety and integrity.


# Next steps

It is too early to tell if derogations, emergency measures, and pandemic-era human rights violations will causally lead to reduced civic space—that data has yet to be collected, and sufficient time still has not passed. At the time of this writing, the majority of the world remains in the throes of combatting the pandemic and only a handful are successfully rolling out vaccines at a large scale. However, preliminary data shows that civil society space and pandemic measures are closely linked, and case study evidence shows that many countries have—and will likely continue to—used emergency powers to directly limit civic space and curtail associational freedoms specifically. Broader indexes like V-Dem’s and more specific counts of treaty derogations can provide useful avenues for identifying pandemic-excused backsliding and rights violations and will be invaluable for future research.
